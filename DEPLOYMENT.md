# Deployment Checklist for GX Clan Panel

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for securely deploying the GX Clan Panel to production.

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Set all required environment variables in your production environment (not in code)
- [ ] Generate a strong random JWT_SECRET (at least 32 characters)
- [ ] Set JWT_EXPIRY to a reasonable value (e.g., "1d" for production)
- [ ] Configure FRONTEND_URL to your production frontend URL
- [ ] Set ENFORCE_HTTPS=true for production environments
- [ ] Configure rate limiting variables appropriate for your expected traffic

### Database Security
- [ ] Use a secure MongoDB connection string with authentication
- [ ] Verify database user has only necessary permissions
- [ ] Enable MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Configure IP whitelisting for your database if possible
- [ ] Set up regular database backups

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Create a strong OWNER_SETUP_CODE for initial account creation
- [ ] After initial setup, consider disabling owner registration
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are properly secured with authentication middleware

## Frontend Deployment

### Build Process
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Deployment Options
1. **Static Hosting (Recommended)**
   - Deploy built files to Netlify, Vercel, or similar static hosting
   - Configure for SPA routing (redirect all requests to index.html)

2. **Traditional Hosting**
   - Upload build files to your web server
   - Configure server to serve index.html for all routes

### Frontend Security
- [ ] Verify Content Security Policy is appropriate
- [ ] Enable HTTPS on your domain
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers
- [ ] Consider adding a Web Application Firewall (Cloudflare, etc.)

## Backend Deployment

### Build Process
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install production dependencies only
npm install --production
```

### Deployment Options
1. **Cloud Hosting (Recommended)**
   - Deploy to services like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Digital Ocean App Platform
   - Use environment variables for configuration

2. **VPS/Dedicated Server**
   - Set up Node.js on your server
   - Use PM2 for process management
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start index.js --name "gx-clan-panel"
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

### Backend Security
- [ ] Ensure all HTTP responses include proper security headers
- [ ] Set up HTTPS using a valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Configure a reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) in front of Node.js
- [ ] Set up IP-based firewall rules
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Post-Deployment Steps

### Verification
- [ ] Test user authentication flows
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test API endpoints for proper authorization
- [ ] Check HTTPS redirection
- [ ] Verify auto-logout for resellers functions correctly

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure error alerts
- [ ] Plan for regular security updates
- [ ] Document backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Create an incident response plan

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep all Node.js packages updated
   - Regularly check for security vulnerabilities using `npm audit`

2. **Secrets Management**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Consider using a secrets management service

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review and rotate access credentials

4. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Set up centralized logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Configure alerts for security events

5. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Implement automated backups
   - Test restoration process regularly
   - Document disaster recovery procedures

## Production Checklist Summary

- [ ] Environment variables configured securely
- [ ] Strong authentication secrets set
- [ ] Database secured with authentication and proper permissions
- [ ] HTTPS enforced on all connections
- [ ] Rate limiting and security headers properly configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Backup procedures implemented and tested

By following this checklist, you'll ensure that your GX Clan Panel deployment is secure and ready for production use.
